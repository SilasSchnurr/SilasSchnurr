### It's-a me!

* ðŸ’¬ Ask me about uncommon algorithmic approaches and crazy one-liners that no one would ever use in production
* â˜• My favorite `java` one-liner:
  ```java
  for (int i = 10; i <= 109; System.out.printf("%6s", ++i % 10 == 0 ? i - 10 + "\n" : "\b" + i % 10 * (i / 10)));
  ```
* ðŸ”ª My favorite `c#` one-liner:
  ```csharp
  Console.WriteLine("n.a.");
  ```
